# TCSS-Tetris
This was the final project for one of my other classes. The back end code was provided, while the front end code was our job to create. It was a lot of fun making this application since we had a lot of freedom to add our own features to the game. It was also a great opportunity to learn about the Model View Controller design pattern.
